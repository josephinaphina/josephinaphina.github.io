							<h1>Our Bodies Are Not Yours</h1>															
								<br>
								OUR BODIES ARE NOT YOURS <br>
								We do not care whether it&rsquo;s a compliment or criticism <br>
								Our bodies are not yours to comment on <br>
								They are not for your gaze to sexualize and objectify<br>
								They are not for you to stare at or criticize <br>
								They are OURS <br>
								They are not a collection of separate parts<br>
								Of unfeeling objects for you to collect, possess, or control<br>
								You can&rsquo;t order one without the other like a la carte items off a brunch menu<br>
								Our bodies are not for your sexual gratification<br>
								WHY are we still fighting for them?<br>
								Something so obvious but rarely considered <br>
								They are not yours to wonder what they&rsquo;re like or what size we wear <br>
								Family, Friends, Colleagues, Strangers <br>
								They are not yours to analyze, think about, and especially not touch <br>
								You cannot objectify our body parts then tell us to cover them when it suits you<br>
								They are ours to care and make decisions for <br>
								WHY? <br>
								Because we were born into these vessels, and no one knows them like we do <br>
								Because we shouldn&rsquo;t be subjected to your unwarranted opinions<br>
								Because we don&rsquo;t want men touching our bodies without permission<br>
								WE ARE TRYING TO LOVE OUR BODIES<br>
								But it is exhausting navigating them through this world <br>
								WE ARE TRYING TO CONNECT WITH OUR BODIES<br>
								But it&rsquo;s taking us a long time to get there <br>
								Because of all the comments, criticism, and projections that women are constantly subject to Because of advertisements and television and movies that only represent one body type <br>
								That tell us we&rsquo;re too big, too small, too tall, too short, too dark, too pale <br>
								We&rsquo;re never good enough, no matter what we look like <br>
								LITTLE GIRLS DESERVE BETTER<br>
								Than being made to believe what is most important is how others perceive them <br>
								How others feel about the proportions of their anatomy <br>
								Instead of how comfortable they feel in their own skin <br>
								TEENAGE GIRLS DESERVE BETTER<br>
								They deserve better than staring in the mirror in the morning and before bed <br>
								Wondering if they&rsquo;re good enough <br>
								Questioning their clothing choices because they&rsquo;re afraid of being labeled as something they don&rsquo;t identify with <br>
								Because of someone else&rsquo;s diluted and brainwashed opinion <br>
								They deserve to know that loving themselves is the only thing that matters <br>
								That loving your body and who you are is the best thing you can do <br>
								That until you love yourself everything else will be harder <br>
								<br>
								Reminders for loving yourself regardless of society and opinions other than your own: <br>
								1. How you feel is more powerful than how you look <br>
								2. That one dimensional version of beauty, health, and happiness they try to sell us is a LIE 3. Every body is beautiful in its own way, own yours because it is yours and it is the only one you will ever have<br>
								4. Don&rsquo;t dress for the male gaze, dress for yourself and other women who will actually notice your effort<br>
								5. Ignore societies expectations of what you can and can&rsquo;t do<br>
								6. Do what makes you feel like the most authentic version of yourself<br>
								7. Love yourself and the others around you radically<br>
								8. They will tell you that you can&rsquo;t, do it anyway<br>
								<br>
